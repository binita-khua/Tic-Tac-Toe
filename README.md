**Tic Tac Toe Game**
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides a responsive and visually appealing interface for two players to take turns and compete against each other.

**How to Play**

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Players take turns by clicking on empty cells to make their moves.
The game ends when a player successfully forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.

**Features**
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be playable on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Hover Effects: Enjoy interactive hover effects on the game cells, providing a visually appealing experience.
Replay Button: After a game concludes, use the "Replay" button to reset the board and start a new game.

**File Structure**
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
styles.css: The CSS file that defines the visual styles and layout of the game.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including moves, win conditions, and replay functionality.

**Game Logic**
The JavaScript file (script.js) contains functions for making moves, checking for a win, determining a draw, and handling game replay.

**Styling**
The CSS file (styles.css) provides a clean and visually pleasing design for the game, with hover effects and a responsive layout.
